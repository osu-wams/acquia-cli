# Acquia Cloud CLI
This project integrates with Acquia cloud v2 API. There is another, more tested CLI tool out there 
by [Typhonius](https://github.com/typhonius/acquia_cli). I would recommend using that package first
We wrote this one with out needs in mind. There is lots of similarities to the other Acquia CLI package 
in code and language.

## Get Started
You will need to create your V2 Acquia Cloud API and Secret.

Copy acquia-cli.dis.yml to acquia-cli.yml and update the keys and secret.
